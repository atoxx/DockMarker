# DockMarker
DockMarker is an OS X Dock Indicator Improvement with some extras


After OS X dropped its running Apps Dock Indicator for the purpose of the tiny Dot below the Dock Icon  
which is useless for visual impaired Users like me, i created this App to add a significantly larger and colored 
Indicator for running Apps.

However, once it was done i started trying out some extras i learned earlier with the Window Server Stuff, 
so DockMarker can alos vreate Window Previews for open Windows and offers them on Dock Icon Hover once they were 
created ...

This is currently a work in Progress, there is a major Memory Leak for the Dock Icon Position,
so call this currently something further than an Alpha but less than a Beta Version, its just a Wannabe finished 
once App. Its current benefit is to se how to use the Accessibility API to get some Informations about an UI Element, or
how to use the Window Server Data to createPreview Images of Windows.
